## Corda Enterprise Network Manager 1.0 on Kubernetes

The Enterprise Network Manager encompasses four main services:

- Doorman Service - Enables nodes to join the network
- Revocation Service - Enables nodes to be removed from the network
- Network Map Service - Provides a global view of the network
- Signing Service - Provides a way to sign approved requests to join the network (CSRs) or revoke a certificate (CRRs) as well as changes to the network map

## Background

There is an increasing demand from our R3 customers to run Corda and its network services on container based technology. It is predicted that more solution engineering time will be requested to consult deploying Corda Enterprise Network Manager and surrounding services. In order to do this we will need a minimal understanding of Kubernetes architecture and how Corda fits into that. 

## How to run 

1. Run the `inital_setup.sh` script followed by the `start.sh` script
2. Check the status of your pods via `kubectl get pods`
3. To pull everything down and recopy the volumes templates run `delete.sh` script

## Interact with CENM & Corda

3. Open shell on one of the pods by `kubectl exec -it --pod name-- -- /bin/bash`
4. If it's a node pod ssh in by `ssh localhost -p 2223 -l testuser` (password in the node.confs)
5. In the shell, run `run networkMapSnapshot` as a sanity check

## To-do

- HSM support
- Corda firewall
- Configuring a way to store certificates properly via either k8s secrets or config maps
- Experiment with a chosen container platform - OpenShift, Amazon EKS, Azure AKS, etc.
- Stress test in a pre-production environnment on cloud.
